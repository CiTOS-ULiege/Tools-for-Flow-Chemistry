This project outlines the construction of a simple, cost-effective data acquisition device for pressure sensors and thermocouples. It provides an affordable solution based on an Arduino Uno board, along with the ADS1115 analog-to-digital converter for pressure sensor readings and the MCP9600-based thermocouple amplifier for temperature measurements. 

The schematic of electronic connections, Arduino Uno code, 3D-design files for 3D-prinitn of the case, and a detailed description of the assembly process are all available within this repository.

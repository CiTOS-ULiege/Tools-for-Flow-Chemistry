This project presents the design and construction of a simple, cost-effective data acquisition device for pressure sensors and thermocouples. It offers an affordable solution utilizing an Arduino Uno board, the ADS1115 analog-to-digital converter for pressure sensor readings, and the MCP9600-based thermocouple amplifier for temperature measurements.

The repository includes the electronic schematic, Arduino Uno code, 3D design files for printing the enclosure, and a detailed assembly guide.

## Holder for a ceramic pressure sensor with excellent chemical compatibility
A holder for a Metallux ceramic pressure sensor with excellent chemical compatibility was designed and successfully tested.

**This pressure transducer is suitable for research in the field of flow chemistry**

### Connectors:
 - Standard HPLC-type connectors (1/4-28UNF)
### Max pressure:
- 50 bar

### Sensor:
- Metallux ME780 (Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> ceramic).
- 5 V DC power input
- Minimal current consumption (max 6 mA)
- Linear output voltage: 0.5 - 4.5 V for 0 - 50 bar

### Wetted materials:
- PTFE
- FFKM
- Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> ceramic

#### More detailed instructions and photographs for DIY assembly are available in the document: "Pressure_transducer_MPS_CiTOS_V1_description.pdf"

The holder was designed using Autodesk Fusion360, and the design files, including .step files, are available in this repository.

#### An affordable reading device based on an Arduino board will be presented in a separate repository.

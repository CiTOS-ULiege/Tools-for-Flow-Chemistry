### This project outlines the development of Filtration and Separation Control Module (FSMCU)

### Detailed information are provided in the file "FSMCU_description.pdf"

The circuit diagram, Arduino Uno code, 3D design files for printing the enclosure, and a detailed assembly guide are all available within this repository.

#### A description of the modified valves used in this project is available within this repository (see 'Electrically-Actuated-Valves-for-Flow-Chemistry').

Constructing this device requires basic knowledge of electronics (reading circuit diagrams, soldering, and performing simple measurements with a multimeter) and access to basic tools (soldering iron, multimeter). Basic familiarity with Arduino programming is also necessary to enable modifications to the software, making this project or its components adaptable for other applications.

### FUR DAPC
This software was developed during research on the furfural nitration platform and successfully operated multiple times, enabling data acquisition from various devices within the platform.

#### Compatibility
The software is specifically tailored for the setup used at CiTOS and will not work with other configurations. However, its components may be repurposed for other flow-chemistry projects.

#### Functionality: The code supports serial (RS232) communication with the following devices:
- FLOM UI-22-110DC pump (acquisition of pressure data and remote control)
- Knauer Azura P4.1S pump (acquisition of pressure data and remote control)
- KERN balance (acquisition of mass readings)
- In-house developed systems: PTMB, NADC, FSMCU (documentation available within this repository)

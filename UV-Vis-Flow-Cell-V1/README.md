## A Holder for 1/16" PFA Tubing Allowing Creation of a Simple UV-Vis Flow Cell

This device allows the creation of a UV-Vis flow cell using a spectrometer and light source with optical fibers equipped with SMA connectors (Avantes, FC-UVIR600-1) without additional optics. The flow cell created in this manner has a limited range due to the absorbance of PFA—measurements below approximately 300 nm are not possible. The optical path length primarily depends on the internal diameter of the PFA tubing.
The device was used with an Avantes spectrometer (AvaSpecULS2048CL-EVO)) and light source (AvaLight-D(H)-S).

#### This repository contains only the 3D design files, enabling you to recreate this design.
Printing from black PLA is recommended - black material shields the system from stray light.

#### Additional parts, such as SMA connectors, are required
Device was tested with two metal SMA connectors (ThorLabs, HASMA, SMA Bulkhead Adapter with Lock Nut) 
Possibly, these connnectors could also be 3D printed (not tested)

#### Installation
The holder was designed for easy installation on the tubing with four M3 bolts, allowing direct attachment without disassembling fluidic connections.


#### Disclaimer
This is a prototypical project and has not undergone extensive testing.

This project focuses on modifying commercially available valves from IDEX Corporation and DIBA-Omnifit (Arcmed) for electrical actuation.
The modification enables fast and precise control of fluidic pathways, eliminating delays caused by manual valve operation.

### The IDEX valve modification

The modified IDEX valve used in this project is the V-101D model. However, the same modification approach can be applied to other models with similar casings, such as the V-101L and V-101T.

#### Wetted materials in IDEX valves:
- PEEK

### The DIBA valves modification

The modified DIBA valves include model 001112 (maximum 3 bar) and model 001122 (maximum 33 bar). Both models offer excellent chemical compatibility, making them well-suited for handling highly corrosive media.

#### Wetted materials in DIBA valves:
- PTFE
- PCTFE


### Detailed descriptions are available in the following files:

*"4Way_IDEX_valve_actuation_V1.pdf"*

*"4Way_DIBA_PTFE_LP_HP_valve_actuation_V1.pdf"*


#### The designed models for 3D-printed parts required for the modifications are available in their respective folders.
